There are four modules in the Homework-2 Assignment

1. models.py
2. MultiAndBernoulliNB.py
3. LogisticRegression.py
4. SGDClassifier.py

How to Run the Codes:
--------------------

> For Generating the Bag of Words and Bernoulli models :

command :  python models.py train_folder_path and test_folder_path

> For generating the training model with Naive Bayes Algorithm (Both Multinomial and Discrete) :

command :  python MultiAndBernoulliNB.py train_folder_path and test_folder_path

> For generating the training model with Logistic Regression Algorithm (Both with Bag of Words and Bernoulli models) :

command :  python LogisticRegression.py train_folder_path and test_folder_path

>For Making the SGDClassifier work with both bernoulli and Bag of words model :

command : python SGDClassifier.py train_folder_path test_folder_path
